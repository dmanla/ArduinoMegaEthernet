# Arduino-Mega Compatible Secure Connectivity Development Platform

**WARNING**: This project is under development and has not yet been validated.

This is an open hardware platform designed for the development of secure wired-network applications. It is fully compatible with all Arduino Mega-compatible hardware and software.

This project was inspired by (but not a copy of) the Freetronics EtherMega: https://github.com/freetronics/EtherMega
This project was created as an alternative to the platform offered by Freetronics.

Features:
- CH340 USB->Serial Converter (Functionally similar to FT232, Driver should be installed automatically)
- Jumper Configurable IO: Certain pins (D3, D6, D8, D9, D13) can be connected to the headers or to integrated peripheral pins.
- 5V 2A USB-C Input
- 6V - 32V VIN Input 
- MicroSD Card Slot
- 10/100 Ethernet provided over SPI using the W5500
- SE050 EdgeLock Plug and Trust Secure Element to provide security features for connected applications, accessible using I2C
- ISM330DHCX Inertial Measurement Unit, accessible using I2C
- MCP7940N Real Time Clock, accessible using I2C
- Level Shifted I2C: Provides connection points for 3V3 I2C Devices (Extra Header), and 5V I2C Devices (Standard Mega Headers)
